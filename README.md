# RedFlags

Red Flags is all about the playful exploration of relationships. Share your insights, cast votes, and uncover red flags with a touch of humor.

## Tech Stack  

**Client:** React, Vite, Codux, TypeScript

**Server:** Firebase

## Features  

- Vote on red flags
- Demographic information  
- Comment section for each red flag
- Data visualization
- User submitted red flags (manually reviewed)

## Lessons Learned  

- I learned a lot about the React ecosystem and how to use it to build a modern web app.
- I found CSS styling to be more painful than initially expected. It takes more work than I would have imagined to make all the buttons look how I want them to!
- I learned about deploying a React app to Firebase, specifically, Vite, tends to do things a little bit differently, so there was a small learning curve there.

## Inspiration

I recently saw a funny graphic and wanted to expand upon and crowdsource the idea:
